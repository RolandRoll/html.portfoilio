<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Chun-Shing Au, a theatremaker from Hong Kong. My work
    explores the intersection of visual poetics and political context through
    object theatre, mask, and puppetry performance. My artistic journey has
    been shaped by my experiences in Hong Kong, Canada, and Prague before
    settling in the Netherlands in 2022 to attend DAS Theatre (formerly
    DasArts), where I graduated in 2024.</p>
    
<p>Together with my wife, Carmen Lee, I co-founded Theatre du Poulet. For
    nearly a decade, we have pushed the boundaries of objects and devised
    theatre. Beyond ‘theatre’ or ‘puppetry’, our practice also extends to
    public spaces and engaging non-professional performers such as
    community members. Additionally, we frequently reflect on the dynamics
    of working as artistic collaborators while being life partners.</p>
